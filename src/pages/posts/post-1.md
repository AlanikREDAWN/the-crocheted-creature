# Why on earth is there a blog here?

Published on: 2025-06-21

Well, that's a _great_ question! Why does a crochet business have a blog?

## The Reason

I wanted this site to have a blog becuase I wanted to provide updates on the progress of my business without having to fight for screen-time on social media. Is it really that simple? Yeah, it is. 

## What I'll be posting about

I'm not exactly sure what kind of content I want to post herfe, so I think I'm mostly going to be figuing it out as I go. I do know however, that I will try to provide progress updates on things like markets I go to and new products I create.
